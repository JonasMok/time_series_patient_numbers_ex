# Explatory exercise using time series methods to predict the number of patients in a local walk-in health centre. 
This repositoy register the main results obtained during a explatory exercise of forecasting using R. I applied time series methods to identify any pattern in the data of a local walk-in health centre. Then, I selected the best models to predict the number of patients. The original exercise was part of an assingment that I have done during my MSc course. 

## Getting Started
It is necessary to download the dataset avaliable in this repository: [TimeSeries_example](TimeSeries_example.xlsx). This file is a fictional dataset built to practise time series methods. 

### Prerequisites

What things packages and libraries you need to install

```
#Work with Date and times
install.packages('lubridate')
library('lubridate')

#Basics stats
install.packages('pastecs')
library('pastecs')
install.packages('DescTools')
library('DescTools')

#Graphics
install.packages('fpp2')
library('fpp2')

```
